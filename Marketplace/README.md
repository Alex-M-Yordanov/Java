### Project Overview
This project implements a client-server application where the client communicates with the server to send commands and receive responses. The communication is handled via Java sockets. The server processes commands and returns appropriate results to the client.

The core functionality includes adding, removing, and listing items, or executing any other server-side functionality that can be implemented based on commands.
